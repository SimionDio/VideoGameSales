# VideoGameSales
The was a data challenge I did at part of interview prep at [Insight](https://www.insightdata.ai/).

## Goal

You work for a data science consulting company. A major video game production company has retained your firm to conduct market research into the video game industry. They've furnished you with video game sales data for the last thirty years (described below) and, as a first project, would like to know:
- What are some major differences between the North American, European, and Japanese video game markets?
- What video game genres are trending in each market?
- What features about a video game are most indicative of its success?

## The Data

This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies.

Rank - Ranking of overall sales  
Name - The games name  
Platform - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)  
Year - Year of the game's release  
Genre - Genre of the game  
Publisher - Publisher of the game  
NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions)  
EU_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions)  
JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions)  
Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)  
Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales.  

## Lessons Learned
- Breadth is more important than depth. Answer each question first before going in-depth on any one answer
- Keep plots as simple as possible. A bar chart is better than a scatter plot, etc.

## Files in the this repo
- _vgsales.csv_: the data
- _VideoGameSales.ipynb_: my notebook as it was at the end of the 4 hour time limit
- _VideoGameSales.pdf_: the presentation I made based off of my origin notebook
- _VideoGameSales_idealized.ipynb_: a notebook made after the fact showing how I would do things in retrospect
